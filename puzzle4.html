										&emsp;“Hi! My name is Zoe and I’m the <span style="color:crimson;">p</span>resident of Waterford Conservatory’s Literature Club! We’re each going to write a poem about our first day of school.” <br>

										&emsp;“Oh.. I can come back later then..?”<br>
										&emsp;“No no, you already ruined my train of thought, here, just take a look … it’s whatever I guess” Elise replies bashfully.

										&emsp;“Wow this is a very encrypted poem with lots of meaning”. <br>
										&emsp;“Hmft, I’m surprised someone as stupid as you could even understand it” Elise said with a smile on her face.

										Annie cleans up her belongings and heads out of the classroom, looking back at you once before disappearing down the hallway.

										&emsp;“Yes sir! I started this club 2 years ago when I was just a freshman. I love writing poems. Reading poems. Slam poetry. Rhymed Poetry. Free verse.

										&emsp;You look around the room and notice... Elise isn’t back yet. The same chill shoots up your spine. 
										“Hey Zoe, Elise went to go find her favorite pen on the first floor, do you know where she is now?” you ask. 
										“I can try and go find her while you help tidy up and pack up Elise’s things. I know the layout of the school well so I should be able to find her quickly!” She skips away while you begin packing Elise’s things.

										You rush on over to the restroom, thinking about new ways to help Caitlyn cheer up. Maybe you can invite her over for a study date. Or you can ask her to work on poems with you again during lunch. Either way, you are going to ask Caitlyn to stay involved with the club activities. With renewed optimism, you head back to the club room.

										&emsp;Walking down the empty hallway <span style="color:crimson;">g</span>ave you a sinking feeling. The school felt so empty after all the students had headed home.

										She looks at you with a slight surprise in her eyes. Stifling a giggle, she says “I think you have to look deeper than just the surface words”. You think to yourself this poem can’t be impossible to decipher. For the rest of the club hours, you work with her to create more poems. At the end of the club session, you think you start understanding some of her poems. <br>

										&emsp;“Thank you for giving me that insightful clue, I think I’m starting to get it now!” <br>

										You walk with Elise to the first floor. As you were walking, you felt a chill shoot up your spine. Elise wasn’t wrong; the school does seem slightly unsettling once everyone has gone home. The classrooms aren’t as vibrant without the dozens of people that usually accompany it. You feel something grab your arm. <br>

										&emsp;“I’m not scared! I’m just a bit clumsy” Elise says, “Anyways, just keep walking. We’re almost at the classroom”. <br>

										When you reach the classroom, Elise commands “wait here, okay..?” <br>
										&emsp;“You don’t have to worry Elise, I’ll wait for you” you reply. Something <span style="color:#F4D03F;">d</span>arts in the corner of your eye. As you peer down the empty hallway, you don’t see anything. “Hmm, must have been my imagination” you think<br>
