										<h2>New entry: 10/8/2009</h2> 
										It is October 8th of 2009 and I set off to this newly found location. The atmosphere felt legendary. As I cut through the jungle, I almost got burnt by a dragon but the water, wind, and earth dragons were nice. As I was leaving, I befriended a crab and met many different people with different lores.

										<h2>New entry: 11/8/2001</h2> 
										It is November 8th of 2001 and I set off to this newly found location. The atmosphere felt like it was coming to an end. As I traversed through the flat terrain, I almost got beat up in hand to hand combat, but barely managed not to get grabbed. As I was leaving, I befriended a pink lady and her pet dinosaur frog.

										<h2>New entry: 11/3/2009</h2> 
										It is November 3rd of 2009 and I set off to this newly found location. The atmosphere felt metallic. As I crawled through the sand, I almost got scammed for buying overpriced soap, but I ended up buying some strawberry jelly instead. As I was leaving, I had to fight a shepherd but not over sheep. 
									</div>
								</div>
								<div style="background: url(images/pic01.jpg); background-size: cover;">
									<div class="page">
										<h2>New entry: 4/1/2003</h2> 
										It is April 1st of 2003 and I set off to this newly found location. The atmosphere felt like syrup. As I climbed up barren mountains, I almost became a warrior, but I forgot to dance with an evil spirit. As I was leaving, I picked up some orange colored mushrooms and sticks from stumps.

										<h2>New entry: 8/2/1992</h2> 
										It is August 2nd of 1992 and I set off to this newly found location. The atmosphere smelled of petrichor. As I hopped into my car, I almost fell, but a cloud helped bring me back on course. As I was leaving, I enjoyed the spacious view and multitude of colors. 
									</div>
								</div>
								<div style="background: url(images/pic11.jpg); background-size: cover;">
									<div class="page">
										<h2>New entry: 11/7/2010</h2> 
										It is November 7th of 2010 and I set off to this newly found location. The atmosphere was very explosive. As I ran out of the house I was staying at, I almost got hit by a bus, but I was dressed in all black so I guess it makes sense. As I was leaving, I enjoyed the small city vibe and the mirrored buildings. 
									</div>

									<div class="page">
										<h2>New entry: 2/5/1996</h2> 
										It is February 5th of 1996 and I set off to this newly found location. The atmosphere was very flowery. As I walked around town, I almost fainted from seeing a ghost, but it was just the mix of a gas leak and some eerie background music. As I was leaving, I enjoyed playing with the animals hidden in the tall grass.
